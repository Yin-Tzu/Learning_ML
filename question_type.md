@ how to get desire numbers?

- @ find a minimize or maxmize solution.
  - & Is desired numbers a minimize or maxmize solution? maybe not, but a minimize or maxmize solution can be a minimizing or maxmizing function which is desired numbers combination
  - & why and how we let desired numbers be a minimize or maxmize solution? 
  - & what is desire numbers and a minimize or maxmize solution relation? 
  - & how to get a minimize or maxmize solution? 
  - & what kinds of Mathematical object is relationship with minimize or maxmize value?
- & have any other method to get desire numbers?
